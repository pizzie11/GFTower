-limit on gun firing speed (think how scattergun tf2 does it)
-fine tune enemy projectiles, maybe figure out a particle effect for it??
-player health, (planning just to go with the normal fps numerical health thing, 100 HP)
-health/ammo pickups
And then in the Long Long term it would be nice to have
-menu screen
-options menu
-pause screen
rest of it really is art assets but next time i sit down to work on it ima gonna start filling more stuff with programmer art lol
oh wait
-i was thinking some stationary floating orb enemy? like a ponderable orb type beat along with the ground wizard type thats somewhat implemented now, think same thing but with a few values/states tweaked, i can open up the Enemy class to make that workable too
